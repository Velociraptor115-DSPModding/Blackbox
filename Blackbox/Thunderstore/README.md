# Blackbox Mod
This mod allows you to "blackbox" sets of buildings together to improve your UPS  
**WARNING**: This is an alpha release of the mod. Use at your own risk or if you would like to help support development of this mod  

## How to use this mod
* First install the mod, and reboot the game.
* Go into blueprint copy mode, select the input station(s) of your blackbox setup and press Ctrl + N  
* Press Ctrl + M to open up the Blackbox Manager Panel to view the blackboxed
* Use "Highlight" to view what buildings got grouped together as a blackbox
* Settings
  * Ideally, you should not need to toggle any setting except for "Auto-blackbox" (I still recommend manual blackboxing at this stage, since the auto-blackbox algorithm goes through the stations in the order they were placed. The algorithm cannot discriminate between blackboxable and non-blackboxable setups without simulating them, so it will probably waste a lot of time on non-blackboxable setups)
  * You can untick "Analyse in background thread" if you want to blackbox in game time and check your blackbox setup for inefficiencies
  * The rest of the settings are currently for debugging purpose. You will only need to change them if you have been in contact with me on the DSP Discord

I will provide clearer explanations once the mod is out of alpha. For now, I just want to get this out there
